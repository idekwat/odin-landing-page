Made a landing page using HTML and CSS
Output may not be a perfect copy of the design but it still uses everything that I'd learned from the previous lessons.
Personally speaking, my usage of flexbox still needs improvement but it is worthwhile to learn since it enhances a websites responsiveness in regarts to the screen size of the user.
HTML may also need further improvement as I used div class A LOT which may not be necessary.
Some CSS capabilities that I researched which wasn't covered on the previous lessons, to my knowledge, were using rounded edges and image resizing.
